## Overview

**GitHub Activity Application** is a Spring Boot project that fetches public GitHub events for a given user and displays formatted messages in a API response as well as Console. The application retrieves data from the GitHub API, uses simplified DTOs to parse the JSON response, and then formats the events into human-readable sentences.
